README

The map segments are generated using seeds specified on lines 28, 29, and 30 of
src/dungeon/DungeonGameplayScreen.cpp. These seeds can be changed. The abstract
map representation is created in src/engine/common/map/MapGenerator.cpp. Chunks
of the map are created using the abtract map segment in
src/dungeon/DungeonEnvironmentComponent.cpp.

The optional requirements for this week, infinite dungeon and frustum culling,
are not fully implemented yet.
